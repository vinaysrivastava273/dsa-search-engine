. Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions Medium Given a string s, determine if it is valid.
A string s is valid if, starting with an empty string t = "", you can transform t into s after performing the following operation any number of times:

Insert string "abc" into any position in t. More formally, t becomes tleft + "abc" + tright, where t == tleft + tright. Note that tleft and tright may be empty.

Return true if s is a valid string, otherwise, return false.
