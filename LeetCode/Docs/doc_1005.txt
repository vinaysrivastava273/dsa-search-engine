. Can Make Palindrome from Substring Medium You are given a string s and array queries where queries[i] = [lefti, righti, ki]. We may rearrange the substring s[lefti...righti] for each query and then choose up to ki of them to replace with any lowercase English letter.
If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is true. Otherwise, the result is false.
Return a boolean array answer where answer[i] is the result of the ith query queries[i].
Note that each letter is counted individually for replacement, so if, for example s[lefti...righti] = "aaa", and ki = 2, we can only replace two of the letters. Also, note that no query modifies the initial string s.
