. Random Pick Index Medium Given an integer array nums with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
Implement the Solution class:

Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the array nums.
int pick(int target) Picks a random index i from nums where nums[i] == target. If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.
