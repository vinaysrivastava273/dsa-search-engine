. Critical Connections in a Network Hard There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.
A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.
Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
