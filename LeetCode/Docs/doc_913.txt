. Video Stitching Medium You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted time seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.
Each video clip is described by an array clips where clips[i] = [starti, endi] indicates that the ith clip started at starti and ended at endi.
We can cut these clips into segments freely.

For example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event [0, time]. If the task is impossible, return -1.
