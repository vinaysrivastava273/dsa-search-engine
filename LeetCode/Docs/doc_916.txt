. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence Medium Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.
Recall that a subsequence of an array nums is a list nums[i1], nums[i2], ..., nums[ik] with 0 <= i1 < i2 < ... < ik <= nums.length - 1, and that a sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i+1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).
